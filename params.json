{"name":"Cultural Evolution Modelling in Python","tagline":"Case Study: Evolution of Cooking Recipes","body":"### About the Project\r\nCultural evolution is the theory that cultural change can be described as a<br>\r\nDarwinian evolutionary process based on the principles of variation, differential<br>\r\nfitness and replication (Mesoudi, 2011; Dawkins, 2006; Richerson & Christiansen, 2013; Richerson & Boyd, 2008). “Culture” in this approach entails any socially (rather than genetically) transmitted information, such as beliefs, knowledge, skills or practices (Mesoudi, 2015).<br><br>\r\nThe present study models evolutionary dynamics of transmission and<br>\r\nmodification of cooking recipes within and between generations of agents.<br>\r\nFood is an essential part of civilization, with a scope that ranges from the<br>\r\nbiological to the economic and cultural levels. Almost every human group <br>\r\nhas its own cuisine, usually one of important aspects of its cultural identity.<br>\r\nCulinary recipes are prime examples of cultural algorithms with strong capacity<br>\r\nfor stabilization, innovation and transmission (Kinouchi, Diez-Garcia, Holanda,<br>\r\nZambianchi & Roque, 2008).<br><br>\r\nEvolutionary processes are modelled computationally in the Python programming language.<br>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAlla Muench, Andreas Daul, Holger Muth-Hellebrandt (@homuhe).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
